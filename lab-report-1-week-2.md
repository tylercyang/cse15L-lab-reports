# Lab Report 1 - How to log into a course-specific account on ieng6

## 1. Installing VScode

To install VScode, go to the [VScode Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions to install
the application onto your operating system. 

Once installed, a window should open similar to this (there may be different colors):

## 2. Remotely Connecting

After installing VScode, if you are on a Windows operating system, you will first need to download the program called
[OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). 

Afterwards, look up your UCSD student account on ieng6 by going to the [UCSD ETS](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) website entering your username and PID.

If done correctly, a page similar to this should come up. For example, if you are trying to ssh into your cse15L ieng6 account, you would use the account `cs15lwi22apb`. However, your letters at the end of the account name may be different.

Now, open a terminal in VScode with *ctrl+*. Then type in `ssh` with your preferred ieng6 account. It should look something like `ssh cs15Lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the zz being your specific account. 

If this is the first time connecting to ieng6 with your specific account, there may be a message that pops up that asks for authenticity. Type `yes` and then hit *enter*. Then enter your password and you should be taken to a page that looks similar to this...

(note: when entering your password, nothing should show up, however if you enter your password correctly and hit *enter* you should be taken here)

If this is your terminal, you have successfully logged into a computer on ieng6!

## 3. Trying Some Commands

Now that you are logged into a computer in the CSE Basement, you can try some different commands out.

Some commands to try are:

* `cd ~`
* `cd`
* `ls -lat`
* `ls -a`
* `ls <directory>` (here directory can be another ieng6 account)
* `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi22/public/hello.txt ~/`
* `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi22/public/hello.txt`

Run these commands and see what they produce.

When I ran `ls -lat`, `ls -a`, and `ls -l` on my terminal, I got these results...

To log out of your ieng6 account, just hit *ctrl+d* or run the command `exit`.
